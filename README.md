## 🔍 Data Exploration Steps

### 📘 Data Understanding
- Loaded the telecom customer dataset into a pandas DataFrame  
- Displayed the first few rows to get an overview of the data  
- Reviewed the general structure and observed types of variables  
- Identified the target variable (`churn`) and key features related to customer behavior  
- Analyzed initial patterns and potential relationships between variables  
- Noted the presence of categorical and numerical variables for further preprocessing  

### 🧪 Inspect the Dataset Structure
- Checked the shape of the dataset (number of rows and columns)  
- Displayed column names and data types  
- Identified and counted missing values  
- Reviewed unique values in each column  
- Inspected summary statistics of numerical columns  
- Checked for and removed duplicate rows  

### 🛠 Data Preparation
- Handled missing values by imputing or dropping as appropriate  
- Converted categorical variables to numerical format using encoding techniques  
- Normalized or scaled numerical features to standardize value ranges  
- Created new derived features for better predictive power  
- Split the dataset into independent features (X) and target variable (y)  
- Divided data into training and testing sets for model evaluation  
- Ensured data consistency and removed irrelevant or redundant columns  

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized the distribution of the target variable (`churn`)  
- Analyzed categorical features using count plots and bar charts  
- Explored numerical features using histograms and box plots  
- Investigated relationships between customer features and churn  
- Detected outliers and unusual distributions in numerical data  

### 🤖 Modeling
- Applied Logistic Regression and Random Forest models to predict churn  
- Trained models using the processed training data  
- Tuned hyperparameters for better accuracy  
- Applied feature selection to improve model performance  

### 📈 Evaluation
- Evaluated models using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
- Compared model performance
- Analyzed feature importance from Random Forest

## 🧾 Summary

- Successfully completed the data analysis pipeline from raw data to churn prediction  
- Extracted actionable insights about customer behavior and retention risks  
- Built and validated machine learning models with strong predictive power

## 💡 Recommendation

Based on the model performance, **Random Forest** is the most effective algorithm for predicting customer churn in this dataset. To further improve accuracy, we recommend tuning hyperparameters such as `max_depth` and `n_estimators`.

Additionally, investing in **feature engineering**—especially by incorporating behavioral or service usage indicators—can strengthen the model's predictive power.

These enhancements will enable more accurate identification of **high-risk customers**, allowing for **targeted retention strategies** such as loyalty incentives, contract upgrades, or proactive customer support interventions.
